<b>OUR MISSION</b> is on advanced photonic chip products in indium phosphide (InP) and gallium arsenide (GaAs) based materials for receiver, transmitter and transceiver components of the optical fiber communication systems.
<br><br>
<b>OUR FOCUS</b> is to bridge the gap between the photonic chip users and manufacturers, by providing and supporting full-custom designs that balance user's needs and manufacturer's capabilities.
<br><br>
<b>OUR STRATEGY</b> is in deep understanding of the photonic industry food chain, good knowledge of theoptical component markets / products, and unique experience of a fabless development by outsourcing to pure-play III-V semiconductor foundries.
